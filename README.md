# Support_Vector_Mechanism

# Project Statement:

#A American based botnical garden a grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different type of varitey flower is grow.

#As a DataScience Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categorys contains same spieces

# Project Title Name:

#Support Vector Mechanism Algorithm of superivsed Machine Learning, Predicit iris.csv dataset to find out the species is same or not.

# Task 1:

#Perprocess the data in skit learn library 

# Task 2:

#Load the data using SkLearn model selection default argument

# Task 3:

#On the bases of dataset or data train test and split SVM Model.

# Task 4:

#Implement the support vector classifer using svm_classifer. The SVM must be "Linear"

# Tasl 5:

#Train the classifer on the training data 

# Task 6:

#Find out te predicition value on the test data

# Task 7:

#Test the Model with the help of accuracy, accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1

# Project Approach:

# Conclusion

#According to my support vector Mechanism Model the species are Linear. Wirth the accuracy of 1.00.
#Hence proved, Model was successfully implement
